  <h2>Welcome Back Banjo!</h2>

  <p>Just recently our trapper Banjo Sydney came back from his expedition from Austrailia. Banjo was able to recover various austrialian animals.
  <p>Banjo was able to bring back a kangaroo, a crocodile, a cassowary, a sheep, and a pelican. All of these animals need a home so if you or someone you know would like to adopt them, that would be great.
  <p>Banjo's Welcome Back Party was last Sunday Septemeber 4th, 2017 for those of you who missed it.
