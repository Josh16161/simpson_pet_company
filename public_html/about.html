<section>
  <p>While we attended Simpson College, we noticed that there was a lot of endangered Indianolan Brown Squirrels.</p>
  <p>After seeing a majority of these squirrels get hit by cars, chased off campus, and get so obese because of the lack of nut control, we knew we had to do something.</p>
  <p>We captured as many squirrels as possible and pawned them off and gave them to trusted friends.</p>
  <p>This is how the dream started. In the present day, we captured a wide variety of animals ranging from the smallest house cat, to the biggest moose.</p>
  <p>We here at the Simpson Pet Company can get you any animal you want at any given time, and that is a company guarantee.</p>
